A Location-Based Parking Sharing Platform

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Smart Parking Share is a web-based platform designed to solve urban parking inefficiency by connecting drivers who need parking with private and commercial owners who have unused parking spaces.

In many cities, drivers waste time and fuel searching for parking, while numerous house owners and parking-area owners have unused parking spaces. This platform enables hour-based parking sharing in a simple, affordable, and scalable way.

This project is developed as a demo-grade real-world solution for IBM Skills Development evaluation.

## ❌ Problem Statement

Urban drivers face several parking-related challenges:
- Difficulty finding parking in new or crowded locations
- Overpriced commercial parking spaces
- Traffic congestion caused by parking search

At the same time:
- Many house owners have parking spaces but do not own vehicles
- Some owners have parking-only land that remains unused

There is no unified system that allows private and commercial parking spaces to be shared efficiently.

## ✅ Proposed Solution

Smart Parking Share provides:
- A centralized parking-sharing platform
- Affordable parking options for drivers
- Side income opportunities for parking owners
- Reduced traffic congestion and fuel wastage

The system supports location-based search, hour-based booking, and rule-based smart recommendations.

## 👥 User Roles

### 1. Driver
- View nearby parking without login
- Login required for booking
- Search parking by current or selected location
- Filter by distance, price, and availability
- Get navigation route
- Book parking on an hourly basis
- Dummy payment simulation
- Extra charges applied for overstay

### 2. Parking Owner
- Can be a house owner, commercial owner, or parking-area owner
- Registers with mock document verification
- Can add multiple parking slots
- Sets price per hour and availability
- Chooses booking mode:
  - Automatic booking
