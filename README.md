# ParkShare – Smart Parking Sharing Platform

## Problem Statement
Urban areas suffer from parking shortages while private parking spaces remain unused.
ParkShare aims to connect drivers with available private parking spaces.

## Solution Overview
ParkShare is a full-stack web prototype that demonstrates:
- Role-based access (Driver / Owner)
- Parking discovery workflow
- Owner listing management
- Dashboard-based UI experience

## User Roles
### Driver
- Search for nearby parking
- View parking details

### Owner
- Create parking listings
- Manage listings from dashboard

## System Architecture
Frontend: React (Vercel)
Backend: Node.js + Express (Render)
Database: MySQL (Demo / simplified)

## Demo Mode Disclaimer
This project is a **functional prototype**.
Some backend logic is simplified to demonstrate workflows rather than production-grade scalability.

## Tech Stack
- React
- Node.js
- Express
- MySQL
- JWT Authentication
- Vercel & Render

## Learning Outcomes
- Implemented role-based authentication
- Designed REST APIs
- Deployed full-stack application
- Handled real deployment issues (CORS, env vars)
- Understood prototype vs production tradeoffs

## Limitations
- No payment gateway
- Simplified database logic
- Limited error handling

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time slot availability
- Payment integration
- Admin analytics dashboard
